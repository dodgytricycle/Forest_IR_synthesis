This is a python implementation of the fast forest reverberator described in:  
*Kaneko, S., Gamper, H., “A fast forest reverberator using single scattering cylinders”. in IEEE 23rd workshop on multimedia signal processing, 2021.*

Dependencies:
  - python (tested on Python ver. 3.7.6)
  - numpy (tested on ver. 1.19.1)
  - scipy (tested on ver. 1.5.0)
  - soundfile (tested on ver. 0.10.3.post1)

Usage:  
  - Run ```ForestReverb.py```  
  ... this script will create a wav file containing an example forest IR with a source-receiver distance of 10m in a forest with 100k single scattering cylinders as "sampleForestIR.wav" next to the python script.
